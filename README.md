Description:

The "All for One" Assignment is a comprehensive project that consolidates the mini API endpoints challenges into a 10-page web application. The focus of this assignment is to build out the front end using Tailwind CSS, creating a user-friendly interface for each API endpoint.

Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling and layout, ensuring a cohesive and responsive design across all pages.

Implement user input fields on each page to gather information from the user relevant to the respective API endpoint.
Display the information retrieved from the backend in a clear and organized manner on the same page.
API Endpoint Pages:
Each page should correspond to one of the mini API endpoints, showcasing the unique functionality of that endpoint.
Example: Restaurant Picker Page:
